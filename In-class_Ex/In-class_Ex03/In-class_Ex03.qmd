**Figure 5 seems to fall under "Quadrant 4 - Confusing but Beautiful"**

#### Some Quick Observations

The figure contains two different charts. Top: Dual pie chart. Bottom: Bar chart

##### {{< fa thumbs-up >}} Areas done well

-   In terms of **Aesthetic**

    -   Colours used is clear and distinct, and able to distinguish the different employment types.

##### {{< fa wand-sparkles >}} Room for further improvement

-   In terms of **Clarity**

    -   Absence of chart title, value labels, proper annotations
    -   Legends were not placed next to (beside) the respective charts, which would not be easy for readers to interpret and understand.
    -   Employment categories could be confusing (e.g. "Employee", "Employee + Other role(s)", "Employee AND Freelance").

-   In terms of **Aesthetic**

    -   The two charts were placed too close to one another without proper demarcation. This could cause misinterpretation of the two separate charts as one chart.

    -   Fill colour for missing values (skipped question) used was white (which could be easily mistaken as white space). Also, missing values could be filtered off for better analysis results.
