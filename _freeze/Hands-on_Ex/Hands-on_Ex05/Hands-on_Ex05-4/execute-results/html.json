Given that groupColumn has to be in categorical format, Happiness Score variable is first binned into 5 groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nbinning <- wh %>%\n  mutate(\n    # binning happiness score into 5 groups\n    happinessGroup = (quantile_Rank=ntile(wh$`Happiness score`,5)),\n    \n    # renaming bin happiness labels\n    happinessGroup = factor(happinessGroup, labels = c(\"Lowest\", \"Low\", \"Average\", \"High\", \"Highest\"))\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## \"anyClass\" Order\n\nSet **order =\"anyClass\"** with `ggparcoord()` for order by maximum of k F-statistics.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nggparcoord(data = binning,\n          columns = c(1:7),\n          groupColumn = \"happinessGroup\",\n          order = \"anyClass\") +\n          scale_color_brewer(palette = \"RdYlGn\") +\n          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex05-4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## \"allClass\" Order\n\nSet **order =\"allClass\"** with `ggparcoord()` for order by F-statistics from an ANOVA.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nggparcoord(data = binning,\n          columns = c(1:7), \n          groupColumn = \"happinessGroup\",\n          order = \"allClass\") +\n          scale_color_brewer(palette = \"RdYlGn\") +\n          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex05-4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## \"skewness\" order\n\nSet **order =\"skewness\"** with `ggparcoord()` for order by sample skewness.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nggparcoord(data = binning,\n          columns = c(1:7), \n          groupColumn = \"happinessGroup\",\n          order = \"skewness\") +\n          scale_color_brewer(palette = \"RdYlGn\") +\n          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex05-4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n# 5.
